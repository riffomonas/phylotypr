# Read in a FASTA-formatted file containing DNA sequences

Given a [standard FASTA-formatted
file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format), `read_fasta` will
read in the contents of the file and create a three column data frame
with columns for the sequence id, the sequence itself, and any comments
found in the header line for each sequence.

## Usage

``` r
read_fasta(file, degap = TRUE)
```

## Arguments

- file:

  Either a path to a file, a connection, or literal data (either a
  single string or a raw vector) containing DNA sequences in the
  standard FASTA format. There are no checks to determine whether the
  data are DNA or amino acid sequences.

  Files ending in .gz, .bz2, .xz, or .zip will be automatically
  uncompressed. Files starting with `http://`, `https://`, `ftp://`, or
  `ftps://` will be automatically downloaded. Remote gz files can also
  be autom downloaded and decompressed.

- degap:

  Logical value (default = TRUE) Removes gap characters from sequences
  indicated by "." or "-"

## Value

A data frame object with three columns. The `id` column will contain the
non-space characters following the `>` in the header line of each
sequence; the `sequence` column will contain the sequence; and the
`comment` column will contain any text found after the first whitespace
character on the header line.

## Note

The sequences in the FASTA file can have line breaks within them and
`read_fasta()` will put those separate lines into the same sequence

## Examples

``` r
temp <- tempfile()
write(">seqA\nATGCATGC\n>seqB\nTACGTACG", file = temp)
write(">seqC\nTCCGATGC", file = temp, append = TRUE)
write(">seqD B.ceresus UW85\nTCCGATGC", file = temp, append = TRUE)
write(">seq4\tE. coli K12\tBacteria;Proteobacteria;\nTCCGATGC",
  file = temp,
  append = TRUE
)
write(">seq_4\tSalmonella LT2\tBacteria;Proteobacteria;\nTCCGATGC",
  file = temp, append = TRUE
)
write(">seqE B.ceresus UW123\nTCCGATGC\nTCCGATGC",
  file = temp,
  append = TRUE
)

sequence_df <- read_fasta(temp)
```
